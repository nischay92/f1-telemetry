# F1 Telemetry Dashboard

A real-time distributed telemetry monitoring system for an F1 car, built using **Python**, **Dash**, **Flask**, and **Docker Compose**.

---

## Architecture Overview

This project simulates and monitors key components of an F1 vehicle using microservices:

- **Engine Service** â€“ Logs engine temperature and RPM.
- **Tire Service** â€“ Logs pressure and wear for all four tires.
- **Brake Service** â€“ Logs temperature and slip values for each brake.
- **Aggregator Service** â€“ Collects data from all logs and updates telemetry state + alerts.
- **Dashboard Service** â€“ Displays real-time status with a Dash-based UI.

All services communicate asynchronously through shared mounted volumes (log files).
