# F1 Telemetry Logger - Distributed System

This project implements a distributed telemetry logger system for a Formula 1 car using microservices and containerized deployment. The system simulates and monitors real-time data from engine, tire, and brake services, aggregates the telemetry with status detection, and visualizes it through a live dashboard built with Dash.

## Architecture

The system follows a microservice-based architecture with the following components:

- **Engine Service**: Simulates engine temperature and RPM, logs values periodically.
- **Tire Service**: Simulates PSI and wear for all four tires, logs periodically.
- **Brake Service**: Simulates brake temperature and slip percentages for each wheel, logs periodically.
- **Aggregator Service**: Reads logs from all services, detects alert conditions, generates system state, and writes logs + telemetry state for dashboard consumption.
- **Dashboard Service**: Dash-based real-time dashboard to visualize engine, tire, brake status, and alert logs.

All services run as independent Docker containers and communicate through a shared mounted volume (`./logs`) to simulate a loosely-coupled distributed system.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for service logic
- **Flask** for health-check APIs
- **Dash** for real-time telemetry dashboard
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for containerization
- **Shell/CLI tools** to monitor containers and logs

## Log Simulation Logic

Each telemetry service simulates time-varying values using basic time-series modeling techniques:

### Time-Series Pattern

We use **sinusoidal functions** to mimic real-world fluctuations in telemetry values such as:

- **Engine Temperature & RPM**: Sinusoidal patterns simulate warm-up and dynamic behavior under load.
- **Tire PSI & Wear**: Pressure gradually drops or fluctuates around a base with noise.
- **Brake Temperature & Slip**: Increases under simulated braking intervals.

Each value includes:
- A **base component** representing the mean or nominal value.
- A **sinusoidal fluctuation** component to simulate periodic changes over time.
- A **random noise** component to introduce realistic variability.

This mimics key behaviors found in real telemetry streams, while keeping the simulation computationally simple.

## Aggregator Logic

The aggregator performs the following:

- Continuously reads new log entries using file seek offsets.
- Parses each log line using regex and extracts metrics.
- Checks values against predefined thresholds (e.g., overheat, low pressure).
- Assigns a status:
  - `green` = normal
  - `yellow` = warning (near limit)
  - `red` = alert (exceeded limit)
- Writes the updated telemetry state to `telemetry_state.json`
- Logs alerts to `aggregator.log` for the dashboard to consume.

This design simulates an **event stream processing** system in a batch + poll manner using time-based snapshots.

## Dashboard Visualization

The dashboard reads from the telemetry JSON and logs every 3 seconds:

- Displays current telemetry values using color-coded status blocks.
- Shows the latest 20 alert log lines.
- Fully responsive and auto-refreshing.

## Architecture Overview

This project simulates and monitors key components of an F1 vehicle using microservices:

- **Engine Service** – Logs engine temperature and RPM.
- **Tire Service** – Logs pressure and wear for all four tires.
- **Brake Service** – Logs temperature and slip values for each brake.
- **Aggregator Service** – Collects data from all logs and updates telemetry state + alerts.
- **Dashboard Service** – Displays real-time status with a Dash-based UI.

All services communicate asynchronously through shared mounted volumes (log files).
